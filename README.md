## Hi, I'm John Munene 
I'm a cybersecurity professional specializing in **offensive security**. With a background in Informatics and Computer Science, I have a solid understanding of how systems work, and how they can be broken.

## What I Do
- Simulate attacks to test and improve organizational defenses
- Develop detections and respond to real-world threats
- Explore adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)

I thrive at the intersection of offense and defense, thinking like an attacker to help strengthen systems from the inside out.

## Sharing Knowledge
I enjoy distilling complex security concepts into practical insights. My blog covers:
- CTF walkthroughs
- Vulnerability analysis
- Security tool reviews
- Hands-on tips for practitioners
